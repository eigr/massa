**Massa** is no longer actively developed

Massa has fulfilled its role as a laboratory for revolutionary ideas on topics such as Serveless, State 
Management, and modern approaches to software development, but the time has come for us to evolve and that's why we chose not to invest more time in Massa and focus on 100 % of our time in the development of the [Spawn project](https://github.com/eigr/spawn). 

[Spawn](https://github.com/eigr/spawn) is a natural evolution to Massa but with a more modular and easier platform to manage, evolve, and experiment.

From now on, the official proxy of our serveless software platform called ***Eigr Functions*** becomes the [Spawn proxy](https://github.com/eigr/spawn).

We at the Core Team would like to thank all those who contributed to Massa, especially to @drowzy, @kianmeng, @ralphlaude, and @wesleimp, we hope that they will also contribute to Spawn.
